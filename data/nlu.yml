- intent: menopausal_symptoms_1
  examples: |
    - I am having my menopause and am now 51 years old. My main problem has been with the hot flushes. I am keen to try something different to HRT and believe that anti-depressants are used with success.

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_2
  examples: |
    - I am 58 years old and have had few menopausal symptoms so decided not to take HRT. However, I do have problems with dryness and irritation of the vagina which also makes intercourse difficult and painful, which I understand is due to lack of oestrogen. What alternatives are there to manage this problem?

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_3
  examples: |
    - I have been experiencing headaches and sickness which seem to coincide with my periods. My doctor thinks I have migraine, but the anti-migraine tablets that I have been given make me feel ill. Is it possible that these headaches are connected to my hormones, and is there anything else I can do about them?

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_4
  examples: |
    - My periods stopped finally about 6 months ago when I was 52years old and I have had no bleeding since. However, I am now presenting with some symptoms and wish to start Hormone Replacement Therapy. I have read about the benefits and the risks involved with HRT and before I discuss this with my doctor. I would like more information on the different types of HRT and which sort would be suitable for me.

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_5
  examples: |
    - I have been having some symptoms of the menopause over the past year and the most distressing is severe sleeplessness. My GP prescribed HRT a month ago but I am feeling no benefit How long should this take and should I take sleeping tablets in the meantime?

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_6
  examples: |
    - I am now 56 years old and nine years ago started on HRT – Premarin 0.625 mg – after surgery for a total hysterectomy and removal of both ovaries. My mother had osteoporosis and, following a fall which meant she was hospitalised, developed complications and died 18 months ago. I was distressed at the amount of pain my mother experienced and how disabling her osteoporosis was and would like to ensure that I take appropriate precautions to prevent this. Is HRT sufficient to protect my bones? Recent media statements have confused me. As I have been on HRT for 9 years should I stop and, if I do, how can I then prevent the onset of osteoporosis ?

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_7
  examples: |
    - I am 50 years old and had a hysterectomy and removal of ovaries 10 years ago. At the time I was given HRT oestrogen only and since feel really well. I was told then that I could continue on into my 60’s with HRT but now my GP wants me to stop. I am in good health,. Had a clear mammogram and my blood pressure is fine, so I need to be able to convince him that I wish to continue.

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_8
  examples: |
    - I have had no periods since I was 54 (two years ago) and have had few menopausal symptoms but I do find that I am more moody and depressed and that my sexual drive has all but gone. This is putting a strain on my marriage, which had previously been a very fulfilling relationship.

- intent: menopausal_symptoms_9
  examples: |
    - Im a 42 year old woman and I haven’t had a period for over six months. I assume I am going through the menopause – especially as I was told four years ago I was not fertile enough to have another baby. I’ve had a bone scan and have a slight bone deficiency in my spine for which I take calcium tablets.I’m worried about any other health problems which could arise from having an early menopause. I’ve asked my doctor but she was quite dismissive. I’m experiencing hot flushes and am finding my memory is becoming terrible which is having a detrimental effect on my self esteem. I was wondering if you had any ideas for boosting my system via supplements which could help.
